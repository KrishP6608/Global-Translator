# Global-Translator

This is a translator app that you can use to translate your speech into text for any language. You first select the language that you will speak in and the language you want as output. 
After you speak into the microphone the app will display the things you said in both your language and the language you chose for it to be translated into. 
This was made with the google translate api and tkniter.
